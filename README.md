Then do 'node server'at the server folder to start our server project, Open http://localhost:3000 to view whether the server works or not in the browser.

Secondly run 'npm install' in the front-end file to download modules which are needed for our login and registration part.
Then do 'npm serve -o', the project will be opened automatically in the browser.
